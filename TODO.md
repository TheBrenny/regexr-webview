# TODO

A set of targets/milestone features that I'd like to see implemented into production, separated into [MUST HAVE](#must-have), [SHOULD HAVE](#should-have), [COULD HAVE](#could-have), and [WON'T HAVE](#wont-have). (See more at the [MoSCoW method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method)).

## Must Have

- [x] Open RegExr in a WebView tab
- [ ] Locally "hosted" and accessible even when offline

## Should Have

- [ ] Code lens action to open RegExr with a regex from which the hint was clicked on
  - (https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/programmatic-language-features#codelens-show-actionable-context-information-within-source-code)
- [ ] Let the user prepare a specific body of content

## Could Have

- [ ] Communicate text changes between the active code editor and the WebView
- [ ] Match the regex code lens to the RegExr link so there's persistence
- [ ] Visualisation of the Regex as a pathway/flow
  - This is probably a change that needs to be done on the actual RegExr app! (https://github.com/gskinner/regexr)

## Won't Have

- (Yeah, this is an empty list for now)
